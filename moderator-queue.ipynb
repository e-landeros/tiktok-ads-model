    "- For each ad and each moderator, a binary decision variable is created to represent whether the ad is assigned to the moderator (1) or not (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Objective Function**\n",
    "- The first objective function to minimize the difference between ad's score and moderator's score, this ensures that the top ads get matched with the best moderators\n",
    "- The second objective function is with regards to the confidence of the ad, which is defined as how confident our model is in identifying whether there is a possible violation in the ad\n",
    "    - If confidence is high, the ad is \"easier\" to moderator as it is easy to spot whether there is a violation. Hence the ad will be allocated to moderators that have high productivity so the ad can be cleared quickly, and low accuracy as a tradeoff\n",
    "    - For ads with low confidence, it will be allocated to moderators that have high accuracy so that violations can be correctly identified, with the tradeoff being low productivity\n",
    "- Combining these two objective functions, the overall objective function is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize: } \\sum_{\\text{ad, mod}} \\left| \\beta_1 (ad\\_score - moderator\\_score) + \\beta_2 (ad\\_confidence - normalized\\_productivity + normalized\\_accuracy) \\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ in the objective function represent weights that determine the importance of matching `ad_score` with `moderator_score` and `ad_confidence` with `normalized_productivity` and `normalized_accuracy`, respectively. Ideally, these coefficients should be derived from an iterative training and optimization process of the Gurobi model. By analyzing the results over multiple iterations and adjusting these coefficients, one can refine the model's performance and achieve better task allocations that meet specific business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to constraints in our current setup, we are unable to conduct this iterative training. As a result, for the purpose of this demonstration, we are using placeholder values for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$, both assumed to be 0.5. This means that, in our current model, both parts of the objective function are given equal importance. \n",

    "- One ad should only be allocated 1 moderator\n",
    "- The total tasks allocated to each moderator cannot exceed their max_tasks_per_day\n",
    "- The delivery_country of the ad must match the market of the moderator\n",
    "- If moderator's category expertise is not null, expertise must match category of ad\n",
    "- If null, each moderator can only be assigned a maximum of 3 ad categories a day\n",
    "    - This is to ensure that the moderator's work is more focused to improve productivity"
